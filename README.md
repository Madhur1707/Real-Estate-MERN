# Overview
The Real Estate Listing Application is a full-stack application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. This application allows users to register, login, and manage their profiles securely with JWT authentication. Users can list properties with multiple photo uploads, view property locations on a dynamic map, and engage in real-time chat with other users.
