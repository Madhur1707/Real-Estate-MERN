# Real Estate Listing Application
## Overview
The Real Estate Listing Application is a full-stack application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. This application allows users to register, login, and manage their profiles securely with JWT authentication. Users can list properties with multiple photo uploads, view property locations on a dynamic map, and engage in real-time chat with other users.

## Features
* Secure User Authentication: Implements JWT for secure registration, login, and profile management.
* Property Listings: Allows users to create property listings with multiple photo uploads using Cloudinary integration.
* Dynamic Map Views: Integrates React Leaflet to display property locations accurately on a map.
* Real-Time Chat: Enables real-time communication between users via WebSockets.
* Responsive UI: Ensures a consistent and visually appealing user experience across devices using SCSS.
* RESTful API: Utilizes Node.js and Express.js to handle efficient data operations and CRUD functionality.
* Scalable Database Management: Leverages MongoDB for robust and scalable database solutions.
